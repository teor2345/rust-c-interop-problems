## Summary
[summary]: #summary

Rust and C++ have different owned string and string slice types, `String`/`string` and `str`/`string_view`.

These types have different memory layouts, valid character constraints, operations, and operational semantics.
In both languages, type layouts are implementation-defined, and can vary based on the compiler, platform, and the origin of the string data (C++).

### C++ to Rust

Most Rust library APIs use the `String` or `&str` types, rather than traits abstracting string storage and operations.
Converting an arbitrary-length string for every C++ to Rust call is expensive. And the conversion may need to handle invalid chracters.
Using `CString` or `OsString` avoids charatcer validity issues, but significantly reduces API compatibility, because fewer APIs support those types.

### Rust to C++

On the C++ side, the situation is similar, many APIs take `string` or `string_view`.
But other APIs take the `basic_string` or `basic_string_view` templates, which could technically wrap Rust UTF-8 strings.
However, maintaining consistent semantics across all string operations is challenging, particularly for writeable strings.

## Related Problems
[related-problems]: #related-problems

Creating and modifying strings at runtime depends on [correct memory allocation and deallocation](0001-incompatible-allocators.md).

String APIs use vectors and iterators, so they inherit most vector and iterator interoperability problems.

## Acceptance Criteria
[acceptance-criteria]: #acceptance-criteria

Solutions should also handle:
- Rust `OsString`
- Rust `CString` (potentially trivially)
- C/C++ `char *`, including `const`, `signed` and `unsigned`
- C/C++ `int8_t *` used as strings, including unsigned

For some use cases, solutions should also handle:
- C/C++ Windows-specific UTF-16 formats (using wide charcter types)

## Impact
[impact]: #impact

Focus on clearly defining the Rust and C++ interoperability problem, and its impact on developers.
It should be factual, informative, and uncontroversial, supported by expert opinion.

This section should explain the problem in detail, including necessary background.
It should also contain several specific use cases where users encounter this problem.

This section is one of the most important sections of the problem statement, and can be lengthy.

It should *not* propose specific solutions, that is the role of Rust / C++ change proposals.

## Guide-level explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the problem as it is typically encountered by Rust / C++ programmers. That generally means:

- Introducing existing language, library, or toolchain concepts.
- Explaining the problem largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how Rust and C++ programmers should *think* about the problem. It should explain the impact as concretely as possible.
- If applicable, provide sample language, tool or execution error messages.

This section should focus on how compiler contributors should think about the problem, and give examples of its concrete impact.

## Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the problem in sufficient detail that:

- Its interactions with other interoperability problems and existing language/library features is clear.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.
- Performance, compatibility, and usability issues are highlighted where relevant. 

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the problem manifests in each example.

## Acceptance Criteria
[acceptance-criteria]: #acceptance-criteria

List the necessary and desirable solution constraints, without committing to any one solution.
If possible, they should be categorised by language, library, or tooling, and also Rust, C++, or both languages.
